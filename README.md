# Colour-O-Matic-for-DA


I'm still working on a bigger and better version, but for anyone who may want a quick and dirty program for checking if two colours could make the colour you want, here! (It also can provide hex codes quickly for comparing colours)

You can look over all the text thanks to GitHub's features before you download, and then just open the file from your downloads.

If you run into any bugs tell me! if you think there's features I should add, ALSO tell me! Feedback of any kind is encouraged, I'm making this to be useful for themers!


Instructions: 
Enter in a colour into the first text box
Then, enter one into the third/last one.
It will give a range of colours between.
You can put a colour in the middle textbox to see if it's possible to breed. This is mostly useful for large ranges of possible colours.
